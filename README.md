# Advent of Code 2017

Note that any input data specific to my puzzles is not included
because you need to do this stuff yourself.

## Reactions
Day 1: This was reasonably easy to do and fun to figure out.

Day 1 p2: WTF? There's a part 2? The second part seems to be a variation on the first.

Day 2: This one was pretty easy also.

Day 2 p2: As long as you understand what "%" does, easy.

Day 3: OMG WTF is this shit?

Day 3 p2: It's more shit! Day 3 required a lot of reading on Reddit to find a solution
that I can at least claim I understand, even if I didn't think of it on my own.

Day 4: Whew! Back to straightforward questions with an algorithmic solution
rather than having to make some bullshit picture to solve it.

Day 4 p2: Simple variation on part 1.

Day 5: This one made me think a bit. I treated it as a list of numbers and mutated it
with the jump vectors. The part 1 solution is pretty quick; the part 2 solution
is slow but it does get the right answer.

Day 6: This one gave me some fits. The redistribution function was simple but I got wrapped around the axle with pass by ref instead of by value and when I tried to loop
to complete the full cycle it kept stopping after one because I was changing
the value of the list on each redistribution... once I figured that out, easy.

Day 6 p2: easy again. just run the function one more time.

Day 7: I'm pretty proud of working this one out without looking anywhere for
help. Ultimately it was more about remembering how to process text to cut
the lines up.

Day 7 p2: Here, on the other hand, I'm stuck. I quit for now and might
go back later. Ultimately since I'm not getting up at midnight to do these
I'm never going to place on the board anyway so fuck it.
